# Operationalizing Threat Intelligence

Threat intelligence should influence decisions, not create noise.

## 1. Detection Guidance

Intelligence can inform:
- what behaviors to watch for
- where to increase logging or visibility
- which detections require tuning

It should not automatically create alerts without validation.

## 2. Prioritization

Intelligence can help:
- rank alerts during active incidents
- focus investigation efforts
- justify escalation decisions

It should not override observed evidence.

## 3. Response Decisions

Intelligence may influence:
- containment urgency
- monitoring strategy
- communication with stakeholders

Actions should remain proportional to confidence and impact.

## 4. Non-Actions

In many cases, the correct outcome is no action.

Documenting why intelligence was not used is as important as acting on it.
