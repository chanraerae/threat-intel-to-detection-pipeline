# Intelligence Decay and Expiry

Threat intelligence loses value over time.

Using expired intelligence increases false positives and operational risk.

## Decay Factors

- Time since publication
- Changes in attacker tooling
- Environmental changes
- Lack of corroboration

## Expiry Principles

- Intelligence should have a defined review window
- Indicators without recent validation should expire
- Behavioral intelligence should be re-evaluated periodically

## Operational Risk

Failure to expire intelligence leads to:
- alert fatigue
- misprioritized investigations
- misplaced confidence

Expired intelligence should be archived with rationale, not silently removed.
