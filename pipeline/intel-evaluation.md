# Threat Intelligence Evaluation

Not all threat intelligence deserves action.

Before intelligence is used, it should be evaluated for relevance, trust, and operational value.

## 1. Source Trust

Questions to ask:
- Who produced this intelligence?
- Is the methodology transparent?
- Has this source been reliable historically?

Failure modes:
- Blind trust in branded feeds
- No differentiation between curated and automated sources
- Lack of attribution

## 2. Relevance

Questions to ask:
- Does this threat apply to the current environment?
- Is the targeted technology in use?
- Does the threat align with observed activity?

Failure modes:
- Global threats treated as local risk
- Intelligence unrelated to deployed systems
- No environmental context

## 3. Specificity

Questions to ask:
- Is the intelligence actionable or descriptive?
- Are behaviors described, or only indicators?
- Can this be validated internally?

Failure modes:
- Vague threat descriptions
- Indicator-only intelligence
- No path to confirmation

## 4. Confidence

Questions to ask:
- How certain is the assessment?
- What assumptions are made?
- What would disprove this intelligence?

Failure modes:
- Absolute claims without evidence
- No stated uncertainty
- Intelligence that cannot be challenged
